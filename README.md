# Bank_Rec_Primary

Here some of the techniques that I have learned and that are employed in this repository:

-importing modules, creating a module object, using dot notation to call functions within a module
-getting the current time using the "time" module and the "time" function - time.time()
-calling the print function, passing an argument to a function
-instantiating a Microsoft Excel object
